# **Automated API Testing with Karate**

## **Project Description**

This project automates the API testing of the "user" service in the [GoRest](https://gorest.co.in/) API. The goal is to validate the correct functionality of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) while maintaining best testing practices and automation standards.

## **Project Objectives**

- Automate CRUD operations for user management.
- Ensure API responses are validated against expected outcomes.
- Implement a structured test automation framework using Karate.
- Utilize external data sources for test execution.
- Maintain best practices in API automation and version control.

## **Project Breakdown**

- **Configuration**: Setting up `karate-config.js`, `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, and `logback-test.xml`.
- **CRUD Implementation**: Creating feature files for API requests.
  - `get_user.feature` â†’ Fetch user details.
  - `post_user.feature` â†’ Create a new user.
  - `put_user.feature` â†’ Update user information.
  - `patch_user.feature` â†’ Modify user details partially.
  - `delete_user.feature` â†’ Remove a user from the system.
- **Execution**: Running the tests via Gradle.
- **Validation**: Ensuring correct responses and response structures.
- **Documentation**: Providing a detailed README and recorded test execution.

## **Sequence and Duration of Activities**

| Activity                               | Duration |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Setup and configuration                | 1 day    |
| CRUD implementation                    | 3 days   |
| Execution and validation               | 1 day    |
| Repository upload and final submission | 1 day    |

## **Resource Identification**

- **Karate**: Framework for API testing.
- **Cucumber**: Behavior-driven development (BDD) syntax.
- **Gherkin**: Structured language for defining test cases.
- **Gradle**: Dependency and build management.

## **Quality Standards**

- Ensure 100% test coverage for API endpoints.
- Use meaningful assertions and validations.
- Implement a modular and reusable test structure.
- Follow proper naming conventions and project structure.
- Maintain version control and proper documentation.

## **Team Organization**

- **Automation Lead (You)**: Responsible for project setup, test implementation, and execution.

## **Final Deliverables**

- Complete Karate project with CRUD tests.
- README documentation.
- GitHub repository with all resources.
